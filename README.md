# RPI LMS Redesign

This project is a small side project trying to flex some of my design skills.

I used three major outside CSS resources, the first of which is [tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) which offered all the base css styles for the pages.
The second resource is [FontAwesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) this is used for some of the small icons.
The third resource is a tooltip hover snippet made from pure CSS designed and built by Chris Bracco (http://codepen.io/cbracco/), the code can be found [here](http://codepen.io/cbracco/pen/qzukg/).

### This project is still a work in progress as of January 29th, 2016.
